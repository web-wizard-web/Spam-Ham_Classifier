# Spam-Ham-Classifier

# 📧 Spam-Ham Classifier 🚀  

A **machine learning-based spam detection application** that classifies messages as **Spam or Ham (Not Spam)** using **TF-IDF Vectorization** and a **Random Forest Classifier**.

## 🌟 Features  
✅ Uses **TF-IDF Vectorizer** for text preprocessing  
✅ Trained with a **Random Forest Classifier**  
✅ Deployable on **Streamlit Cloud**  
✅ Accepts user input and predicts spam/ham messages  

Project Structure

1️⃣ Clone the Repository**  
```sh
git clone https://github.com/your-username/Spam-Ham_Classifier.git
cd Spam-Ham_Classifier

2️⃣ Install Dependencies
pip install -r requirements.txt

3️⃣ Run Locally with Streamlit
streamlit run app.py

🎯 Model Training (ham.ipynb)
The model is trained using:
✅ TF-IDF Vectorization for feature extraction
✅ RandomForestClassifier for classification

To retrain the model:

Open ham.ipynb
Run all cells to train and save:
spam_model.pkl (Trained model)
tfidf_vectorizer.pkl (Vectorizer)
